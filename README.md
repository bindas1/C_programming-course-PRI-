First semester programming course in C on Warsaw University of Technology

Project1 -> bubble sort


Project2 -> documenatation in project folder (in polish):

Write a picture management program. Main functions of the program: adding an image, deleting an image, changing any parameter, displaying a list of images, sorting images with a variable criterion. The image is characterized by: image height, image width [in pixels], type {B8, B16, B32, C24, C16}, unique name (!!) and image characteristics: average normalized intensity (0-255), dominant color (vector [L, a, b]), normalized histogram (8 element vector). Take the maximum number of images equal to 100.


Project3/4 -> documentation in polish in repository

Write a picture management program. Main functions of the program: adding an image, deleting an image, changing any parameter, displaying a list of images, sorting images with a variable criterion. The image is characterized by: image height, image width [in pixels], type {B8, B16, B32, C24, C16}, unique name (!!) and image characteristics: average normalized intensity (0-255), dominant color (vector [L, a, b]), normalized histogram (vector elemental k). Take the maximum number of images equal to M.
1.Implement the function of loading and saving the image in PGM, PPM format.
2. Implement the function of histogram equalization or convolutional filtration with a defined transformation nucleus (mask).
